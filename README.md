# ArenaServer

WIP

## Description

Server application for a simple top down multiplayer spacecraft shooter game, using web-sockets and Redux for the client side.
The projects intention is mainly to get used to Redux, and to find out if and how Redux can be used to create games.

The server runs on Elixir Phoenix, and holds all game states into memory by using GenServers.

___________________________

To start your Phoenix app:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `npm install`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phoenix.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
